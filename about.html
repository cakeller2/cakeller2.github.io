        <h2 class="subheader">My name is Camryn Keller and I am a Software Engineering Student</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Junior at Quinnipiac University. Before college I lived outside of Philadelphia in PA.</p>
        <p>In high school, I didn't really touch coding at all. My dad is a programmer so I watched him but never did it myself.</p>
        <p>As an undeclared freshman, I got to do stuff I can never done before. My coding lab professor, Professor Alex Thimineur helped me discover my love for programming </p>
