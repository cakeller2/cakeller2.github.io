        <h2 class="subheader">My name is Camryn Keller and I am a Software Engineering Student</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Junior at Quinnipiac University. Before college I lived outside of Philadelphia in PA.
        In high school, I didn't really touch coding at all. My dad is a programmer so I watched him but never did it myself.
        As an undeclared freshman, I got to do stuff I can never done before. My coding lab professor, Professor Alex Thimineur helped me discover my love for programming 
        As of right now, I have experience with Kotlin, Scala, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and Java. In my free time, I love playing video games and reading. I am currently playing through God of War: Ragnarok and having a wonderful time</p>
